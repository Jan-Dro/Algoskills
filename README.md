# Algoskills

Welcome to the **Grokking Algorithms & LeetCode Showcase** repository! This project is a simple, HTML-based learning resource inspired by the chapters of *Grokking Algorithms*. It pairs theoretical concepts with practical implementations by showcasing three LeetCode problems per chapter, where each problem demonstrates the current algorithm you learned. The repository is set up to be easily expandable into a full-fledged learning platform.

## Overview

This repository contains a single-page HTML learning tool that guides you through the core algorithms discussed in *Grokking Algorithms*. For each chapter, you'll find:

- A brief explanation of the algorithm.
- A practical example with an implementation on LeetCode.
- Code samples to help solidify your understanding.

The goal is to blend theoretical learning with hands-on coding practice.
